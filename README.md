# DROIDEX

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache--2.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

DROIDEX is a macOS desktop workspace for coding agents, including Factory
Droid, Claude Code, and Codex. It keeps chats, projects, terminals, browser
sessions, and agent work together in one app.

## License

DROIDEX is open source under the [Apache License 2.0](LICENSE). You may use,
modify, and redistribute it, including commercially, as long as you follow the
license: keep the copyright and attribution notices, ship the [NOTICE](NOTICE)
file, and state prominently in any file you changed that you changed it.

The DROIDEX name, logo, and visual identity are not covered by the license. If
you fork DROIDEX, rename your build and say plainly that it is a fork of
DROIDEX, with a link back here. [TRADEMARKS.md](TRADEMARKS.md) covers what
that means in practice. Fork it, build on it, sell it if you like; just do not
present it as though you wrote it.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome: bugs, fixes, features, and documentation.
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) covers the development setup, the checks to
run, and the commit sign-off. [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) is the engineering guide
the review holds changes to, and [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
applies to everyone taking part.

## Run it locally

You need Node.js 22, npm, and at least one supported agent CLI. DROIDEX can
install the Factory Droid CLI during onboarding if it is not already available.

Install dependencies and launch the desktop app:

```bash
npm install
npm ci --prefix sidecar
npm run electron
```

For renderer-only development, use:

```bash
npm run dev
```

To run a second dev instance beside your main app, isolate both its profile and
history writer (raw Factory transcripts are still discovered). Electron places
the isolated history database in `<profile>/history`; a bare sidecar can set
`DROIDEX_HISTORY_DIR` explicitly. The default app keeps `~/.factory/droidex`:

```bash
ELECTRON_START_URL=http://127.0.0.1:1421 BRIDGE_PORT=8766 \
DROIDEX_USER_DATA_DIR="$HOME/Library/Application Support/DROIDEX-dev" \
npm run electron
```

## Tool activity and review

Settings → Tool activity controls how much detail appears inside tool runs:
compact summaries, balanced expandable rows, or detailed output. Completed turns
keep one Worked disclosure followed by the final answer at every density.
Read output is available inside the disclosure; compaction markers stay visible.
The streaming caret indicates arriving text, while Working stays visible until
the turn finishes, including gaps between tokens.

Click a changed file to open Review with its captured diff; its disclosure arrow
opens an inline preview. Repeated edits show
the latest captured change and its matching line counts, even when Git has a
different cumulative diff. Selecting a Review scope returns to its live Git changes. Path-only previews use
the workspace Files permissions and reject paths or symlinks outside that folder.

## GitHub pull requests

For GitHub repositories, the Context panel shows pull requests, checks, and
review comments through GitHub CLI. If `gh` is missing or signed out, DROIDEX
shows the recovery action in Context. It can install `gh` through an existing
Homebrew installation; otherwise it opens GitHub's official installation page.
Authentication always completes through GitHub CLI's browser/device flow. The
Context popover keeps the one-time code visible and copyable until `gh` confirms
the account is connected.

## Useful commands

| `npm run build` | Create a production build |
| `npm run test` | Run app and Electron tests |
| `npm --prefix sidecar run test` | Run sidecar unit tests |
| `npm run typecheck` | Check app TypeScript |
| `npm run sidecar:typecheck` | Check sidecar TypeScript |
| `npm run format:check` | Check formatting |

## Manage parallel work

Use **Customize sidebar** (the filter-lines button above your workspaces) to switch
between workspace grouping and **Activity / status**. Activity separates tasks
that need attention, working tasks, ready conversations, and settled work.
Workspace rows show the same status indicators.

Choose **Mark as settled** from a chat’s action menu after reviewing a result. The conversation stays available
under **Settled**, with a **Reopen task** action. New activity brings it back;
running tasks and tasks awaiting your approval or answer cannot be settled.
Settling is an organizational action, not cancellation or deletion.

The customize menu also controls ordering, tasks shown per group, and status
filters. **Last active** keeps resumed older chats near the top, including after
restarting. Sidebar preferences and the latest 1,000 settled task markers are saved per local profile.
Markers for hidden chats and newer activity are removed automatically.
**Pull request** grouping and the search button beside notifications use PRs detected for the chat’s
worktree automatically, including chats you have not opened. Discovery runs on
startup and every minute while the app is visible, independently of the Context
panel. GitHub CLI must be signed in. Lookups stop waiting after 10 seconds. If the underlying operation is still running,
discovery skips that lookup until it finishes while continuing to refresh other worktrees.
Restarting the app clears a stuck IPC call.
Each chat retains its 10 most recently detected PRs. At the 1,000-chat metadata limit,
opening a chat can replace an older automatic PR entry; names, pins, and hidden-chat markers take priority. Search linked PRs by number, URL, title, or
branch. Links survive restarts and branch changes; detected PR status refreshes
automatically. A full PR URL distinguishes repositories that use the same number.

The bell filters unread conversations; selecting one clears that unread filter.

## Updates

DROIDEX checks its signed Sparkle feed for new versions. A blue download button
appears beside Settings only when a newer version is available. Clicking it
opens Sparkle's native update window; nothing downloads or installs until the
user approves it. You can also check manually from the DROIDEX menu.

Official macOS downloads and first-launch instructions live in the
[public releases repository](https://github.com/droidex-anas/droidex-releases).
The permanent website links and tag-controlled publishing flow are documented
in `docs/releasing.md`.

## Privacy and diagnostics

Automatic crash reports and Sentry Release Health are enabled by default in
release builds. They use a random local profile ID and can include crash stacks,
native crash dumps, and technical device/runtime context. Crash material can
contain incidental sensitive data; access belongs only to the private DROIDEX
Sentry project. DROIDEX does not intentionally attach account identity or use
Sentry for feature analytics.

Users can turn automatic diagnostics off under **Settings → Privacy &
diagnostics**. Changing the preference restarts DROIDEX. Disabling it stops
automatic reporting and deletes the local profile ID. `/bug` and `/feedback`
reports are sent only when the user explicitly submits them; while automatic
diagnostics are off, those reports use a non-persisted report-scoped ID.
