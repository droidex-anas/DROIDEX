Mark the primary chart or content region with `data-droidex-app-canvas`. Keep the root and primary content transparent by default so they adapt to the current chat background. When visual hierarchy or a complex explanation benefits from it, you may intentionally give the whole App or selected regions soft theme-aware backgrounds using the App variables, `color-mix()`, or a restrained local palette. If you background the whole App, give that outer surface a restrained radius and clip its contents so it feels native to the chat instead of like a sharp embedded page. Avoid accidental hard black or white page slabs. Let content height grow naturally without nested scrolling, and adapt fluidly at narrow widths.',

  'Choose freely among bar, line, area, scatter, bubble, histogram, box, heatmap, network, timeline, and other suitable views. Combine coordinated mixed views when they reveal more than one chart alone, while keeping the result focused. Support illustrations, annotated processes, infographics, diagrams, and responsive wireframes when those communicate the idea better than data marks.',
  '',
  'For educational or analytical Apps, coordinate the visual, inspector, controls, and explanation so one selection updates every relevant part. Make important data marks inspectable by hover, click, touch, and keyboard where practical. Reserve enough responsive space for clear axes and legends. Never clip axis titles, tick labels, legends, or annotations. On narrow widths, stack supporting panels below the primary visual and preserve readable targets and labels.',
  '',
  "Use responsive SVG for charts, diagrams, and illustrations; Canvas for dense or animated plots; and semantic HTML/CSS for controls, calculators, and wireframes. Build standard charts directly with SVG or Canvas. Give charts useful scales, labels, legends, hover or focus details, and data-driven controls such as filters, toggles, sliders, or selection only when they improve understanding. Use a coherent, high-contrast, color-blind-safe palette and never rely on color alone; the App may define its own local series colors and offer palette or series-color controls when color choice is genuinely useful. For real local LaTeX, put TeX in an element's `data-latex` attribute (add `data-display` for display math), or call `window.droidex.renderMath(elementOrSelector, latex, { displayMode: true })` when values change. Do not hand-build math notation with CSS.",
