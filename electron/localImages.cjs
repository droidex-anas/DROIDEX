 * Local image source for the renderer.
 *
 * The renderer runs from http://localhost in dev and file:// when packaged, so
 * an `<img src="/Users/me/shot.png">` either 404s or resolves against the wrong
 * root. Transcript images (assistant markdown, pasted attachments) therefore go
 * through the `droidex-img://` scheme, whose URLs carry the absolute path in a
 * query parameter so Chromium never path-normalizes it.
 *
 * Reading is deliberately narrow: a real regular file, a known image extension,
 * and a size cap. It is registered only on the default session, so pages loaded
 * in the Browser pane (a separate partition) cannot reach local files with it.
 *
 * Kept free of `require('electron')` so it can be unit-tested under plain Node.
